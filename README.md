# homepage

This project is a fully responsive homepage built with HTML and CSS. It was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice advanced layout and responsive design skills. The goal was to replicate a design across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes, focusing on layout structure and visual polish rather than content.
